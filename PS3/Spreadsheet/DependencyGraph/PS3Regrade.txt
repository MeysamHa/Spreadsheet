  My public void AddDependency(string s, string t) it was not right 
  My dependees read t but Ichanged it to dependents and also I add new extention "has"
  to help my class for adding method to string. 
  
  //check for a given string to have dependents or dependees based on user specification.
  return true if string has specified dictionary, false otherwise. 
  
  public static bool has(this string s, Dictionary<string, HashSet<string>> d)
  
        {
            return d.ContainsKey(s);
